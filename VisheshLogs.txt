Final Goal : 
    Delivering results by third week of May 2025. 
    Mediocrity is weakness. 
    Comfort is decay and death.
    Coming second means coming first amongst all the ones who lost. 
    
Problem Statement : Predicting the disease on the basis of symptoms and explaining why did AI come to that decision in the first place. Basically
                    destroying the black box nature of AI.

Tracking Progress :

1. Devised workflow
    Phase 1 : Finding and cleansing Dataset
    Phase 2 : Applying DL Models to find relation between disease and their symptoms
    Phase 3 : Applying explainability to find the reason of conclusion
    Phase 4 : Applying generative AI to convert graph output(assumption) of step 1.3 into a human readable report

2. Resources : Kaggle and mendley for dataset. More details on Notion.

3. Current progress : 
    3.1) Activate Phase 1
    3.2) Datasets found, cleansing in progress 
    3.3) Assigned finding of DLM to the team
    3.4) Beginning use of pandas for data cleansing
    3.5) Expected results by 07.04.2025 23:59:59
    3.6) This is going to be a hell. And stopping in hell is idiotic. 

4. Unthought challenge : 
    It isn't necessary that a disease causes all the symptoms as mentioned in our dataset. Also, it is quite possible that there are weights to 
    symptoms. Like the extent of a particular symptom(rash for example) might determine the disease a person is suffering from. Also, the 
    timeline of disease is also something to think about (quite possible that 'fever followed by rash' is a different disease from 'rash 
    followed by fever')

5. Phase 1 Complete on 07.04.2025 22:55:12: 
    DiseaseAndSymptoms.csv -->  Dataset1.xlsx
    symbipredict_2022.csv  -->  Dataset2.xlsx
    OriginalDS/Final_Augmented_dataset_Diseases_and_Symptoms.csv  --> Dataset3.xlsx

6. Phase 1 completed on 19.04.2024 16:51:32:
    All datasets integrated into one. Ready for applying model. 




------------ Phase 1 Ends ------------

1. Phase 2 activated. 

2. Proposed workflow : 
    Apply a LightBGM model to find disease using symptoms. At this stage, the input will be fed exactly same as input labels of the dataset. 
    Delegated to Saketh.
    Developing a NLP model that can see and match input symptom given as a list separated by commas and match it to the labels of the input 
    dataset. 

3. Current state : 
    3.1) Phase 2 activated. 
    3.2) Pre trained semantic model all-MiniLM-L6-v2 is used so that the semantic of the user input can be equated with the semantic of all 
    the symptoms in the database. 
    3.3) Basic model shaped right now. Improvisations to be carried out by Tanishta. Checking of the model to be handled by Saketh. 
    3.4) Waiting for the LightBGM. Once both are good to go, they will be integrated. Then proceeding to the third phase, the final boss, 
    applying explainability. 
    3.5) This is going to be a hell. And stopping in hell is idiotic.
